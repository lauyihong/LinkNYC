## Legally Operating Businesses
This data set features businesses/individuals holding a DCA license so that they may legally operate in New York City. Note: Sightseeing guides and temporary street fair vendors are not included in this data set.

*Due to COVID-19 pandemic, DCA extended certain license expiration dates and renewal application deadlines which are not reflected in this data set. For more information, visit nyc.gov/BusinessToolbox.*
